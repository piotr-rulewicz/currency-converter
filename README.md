# Currency Converter

## Description

A simple currency converter as continuation of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The code includes: the form with a choice of options, normalize.css and the BEM convention.
In JavaScript code I used **arrow functions**.

## How it's working

This currency converter converts PLN currency to others, like EUR, CHF, USD and JPY, according
to given exchange rates.

## Warning

**The exchange rates used in the tool are exemplary. The calculator is for practice only**.
